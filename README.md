## Why I have created this bot?
My friends and I used to play the legendary "Counter Strike 1.6".

Usually we used to connect to some empty dedicated server and play on it.

We were happy.

But then dark times has come.

Some random player once connected to our game.

And has kicked our asses, and it has become very often thing.

We decided to solve this problem.

And we have developed this chat bot.

And now - we are happy!
